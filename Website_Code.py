                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on this github repo.
                This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.

    ### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

    **1. What is the Plant Disease Recognition System?**  
    The Plant Disease Recognition System is a web application designed to help users identify plant diseases by analyzing images of plant leaves. The system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions and recommendations for treatment.

    **2. How do I use the app?**  
    To use the app, navigate to the **Disease Recognition** page, upload an image of a plant leaf with suspected disease, and click the **Predict** button. The system will analyze the image and display the predicted disease along with causes and recommended treatments.

    **3. What types of plants and diseases can the system recognize?**  
    The system is trained to recognize a variety of plants and their associated diseases. Currently, it supports the following plants and diseases: 
    - Apple: Apple scab, Black rot, Cedar apple rust
    - Tomato: Late blight, Early blight, Bacterial spot
    - And many more! For a full list, please refer to the disease information section.

    **4. What should I do if the app does not recognize a disease?**  
    If the app cannot identify a disease or provides an incorrect prediction, please double-check the image quality. Ensure that the plant leaf is clearly visible, well-lit, and free from obstructions. You can also provide feedback to help improve the model.

    **5. How can I find information about a specific disease?**  
    You can navigate to the **Disease Information** section and use the dropdown menu to select a specific disease name. The app will then display information about the disease's causes and recommended fertilizers or pesticides.

    **6. What are the recommended fertilizers and pesticides?**  
    The app provides specific recommendations for fertilizers and pesticides based on the predicted disease. These recommendations are designed to help manage the identified diseases effectively.

    **7. Is there a limit to the number of images I can upload?**  
    Currently, there is no strict limit on the number of images you can upload for analysis. However, please allow some time for processing if you upload multiple images at once.

    **8. Who can I contact for further support?**  
    If you have any additional questions or need further assistance, feel free to contact our support team at [helpplantdisease@gmail.com] or use the contact form provided in the app.

    ### Help Section

    **Tips for Uploading Images**
    - **Image Quality**: Ensure the images are clear and in focus. Avoid blurry or low-resolution photos for better prediction accuracy.
    - **Lighting**: Take photos in well-lit conditions to capture the true colors and details of the leaves.
    - **Background**: Use a plain background to minimize distractions and improve recognition accuracy.

    **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
    - **Image Not Uploading**: If your image fails to upload, check your internet connection and try refreshing the page.
    - **Slow Processing Time**: Depending on your internet speed and the server load, processing time may vary. Please be patient while the model analyzes your image.
    - **Unexpected Predictions**: If you receive an unexpected result, consider the quality of the image and the angles from which the photo was taken. Retrain the model with new data for improved accuracy if necessary.

    **Feedback and Improvement**
    We welcome your feedback to improve the app! If you encounter issues or have suggestions for enhancements, please let us know through the contact form or email.
